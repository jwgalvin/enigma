Welcome to Joe's Super handy encryption software!  Worried about the gubmint coming for your trove of dogecoins? Need to keep secret from the deep gubmint agents? This is your way to do it!

====Self-Assessment====
TDD & VCS: 2.5 While I did a good job committing as I went, it wasn't until the project was 80% done that I remembered to use different branches and pulls. Had I done that I'd have given myself a 3.5. I need to slow down.
OOP      : 3.0 I used a module and a class to keep things clean.  The helper module contains everything the enigma class needs to do its job.
Function : 3.0 This does everything the project is supposed to do.  

Conventions: 3.0 I used understandable naming conventions and properly indented everything.
